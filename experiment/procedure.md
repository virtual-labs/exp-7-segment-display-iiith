1. Firstly learn everything from the 'Demo' section.
2. Then, test your understanding about Decoder in the 'Pretest' section.
3. Then in the 'Practice' section in the task-1 "Decoder", make a BCD to 7-segment decoder circuit using logic gates and test it with different inputs.
4. Then, in the task-2 "7 Segment Display", connect the 7 Segment display to the decoder circuit and analyse the circuit for different values of A,B,C,D.
5. After that, test your understanding of the experiment in the 'Posttest' section.
