1. Design the BCD to seven segment display decoder as given in the theory section. Save this circuit which takes four inputs D,C,B, A and produces 7 outputs a,b,c,d,e,f,g.

2. The Seven segment display designed above can display digits from 0 to 9. Now design a circuit which can display hexadecimal numbers 0-9 and A-F. Start by making K-maps for a,b,c,d,e,f,g and use seven 4:1 / 8:1 multiplexers, each generating one output.
Save this circuit with appropriate name.

3. A 4-bit ripple adder has been made in Experiment 1. It takes two 4-bit numbers A3A2A1A0 and B3B2B1B0 as inputs and generates their sum S3S2S1S0 and final carry C-out.
Save the 4-bit ripple adder by marking appropriate inputs and outputs.
Import the seven segment hexadecimal display designed in question 2.
Import the 4 bit ripple adder.
Connect the outputs S3S2S1S0 of ripple adder to the inputs ABCD of 7 segment hexadecimal display. Give two 4-bit binary numbers as inputs to ripple adder and see if their sum is being displayed by the seven segment hexadecimal display.
